## Session Description

Let's add some geometry back into our vector spaces! This session introduces the idea of the "inner product" (or dot product in $\mathbb{R}^n$) as a way to measure things like the "length" of a vector and the "distance" between vectors. Most importantly, it gives us a precise way to define "orthogonal" (or perpendicular) vectors. We'll explore orthogonal complements – the set of all vectors truly perpendicular to a given subspace, and see how they connect fundamental spaces we've already studied.

Building on this, we'll look at "orthogonal sets" of vectors, where every pair is perpendicular. These sets are really special because they're automatically linearly independent, and if they also span the space, they form an "orthogonal basis" – which makes finding coordinates ridiculously easy! Finally, we'll learn how to "orthogonally project" a vector onto a subspace. Think of this as finding the closest point in that subspace to the original vector, a super useful tool with lots of applications (related to the Best Approximation Theorem).
