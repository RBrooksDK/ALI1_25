## Session Description

Alright, this is our final scheduled session! We've covered a massive amount of material in applied linear algebra, building from solving basic systems all the way through vector spaces, transformations, eigenvalues, orthogonality, and powerful factorizations like the SVD.

This session is purely dedicated to *you*. It's a recap and Q&A session. Bring questions you have about *any* topic we've touched on throughout the course. We'll work through them together, and I'll do my best to clarify any concepts or problems that are still unclear. This is your chance to solidify your understanding and ensure you're ready for the final exam.

### Key Concepts
