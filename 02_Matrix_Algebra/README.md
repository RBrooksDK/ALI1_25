## Session Description

Now that we’ve learned to represent and solve systems with matrices, this session focuses on doing algebra with matrices themselves. We’ll start with basic operations like addition, scalar multiplication, and then tackle matrix multiplication — both its definition and the practical row-column rule.

We’ll explore special matrices (zero, identity, diagonal), powers, and transposes, and discuss how matrix operations differ from regular arithmetic. Key theorems (1–3 for operations, 5–7 for inverses) will guide us through the rules. A central idea is the invertible matrix and to find it using row reduction.

We’ll finish with the Invertible Matrix Theorem (Theorem 8), which ties together many core ideas.

### Key Concepts

* Matrix Operations
* Matrix Multiplication
* Special Matrices: Zero, Identity, Diagonal
* Matrix Powers
* Matrix Transpose
* Invertible Matrices
* Invertible Matrix Theorem
* Matrix Algebra
