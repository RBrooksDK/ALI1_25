## Session Description

Building on our understanding of orthogonal vectors and bases, this session focuses on powerful techniques and applications related to orthogonality. First, we'll learn the "Gram-Schmidt process" – a step-by-step method to turn *any* basis for a subspace into an orthogonal (or orthonormal) one. This is a fundamental algorithm! Related to Gram-Schmidt is the "QR factorization," a way to break down certain matrices into a product of a matrix with orthonormal columns and an upper triangular matrix.

Then, we'll tackle a super common problem in real-world data: what do you do when a linear system $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has *no* exact solution? We'll introduce "least-squares" solutions – the 'best possible' approximate solutions that minimize the error. Geometrically, finding the least-squares solution involves projecting the vector $\mathbf{b}$ onto the column space of matrix $A$. We'll see how these least-squares ideas are applied, especially in fitting models to data (like finding the 'best' line through a set of points).
