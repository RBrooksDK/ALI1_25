## Session Description
Moving beyond just vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$, this session introduces the more general idea of "vector spaces" – abstract collections of objects that behave like vectors. We'll look at special subsets within these spaces called "subspaces." A major focus will be on two important subspaces connected to any matrix: the "Null Space" (all the vectors that get mapped to zero) and the "Column Space" (everything that can be reached by combining the matrix's columns). We'll also touch on how these relate to linear transformations.

A crucial concept we'll build up to is finding the most efficient way to describe or generate a space – this leads us to the idea of a "basis," which is a minimal set of vectors that spans the entire space and is linearly independent. Once we have a basis, we can define unique "coordinate systems" within the space. We'll then use the basis to define the "dimension" of a vector space – essentially, how many independent directions you need to move within it. Finally, we'll define the "rank" of a matrix, which is closely tied to the dimension of its column space and tells us a lot about the structure of the matrix and related linear systems.
