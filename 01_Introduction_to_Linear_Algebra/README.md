## Session Description

We'll begin with systems of linear equations, what they are, how to represent them with matrices, and how to solve them using row reduction. You'll learn key row operations, how to reach echelon forms, identify pivots, and determine basic and free variables. We'll cover when systems have unique, infinite, or no solutions, revisiting concepts like Theorem 2.

Next, we introduce vectors: linear combinations, spans, and how vector equations relate to linear systems, with geometric intuition in 2D and 3D. We'll examine linear dependence and independence, identifying redundant vectors and linking this to simple homogeneous systems (Theorems 7â€“9). Finally, we'll introduce linear transformations, how matrices map vectors between spaces, laying a vital foundation for what's to come.
