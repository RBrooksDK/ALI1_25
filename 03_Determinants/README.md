## Session Description

This session introduces the concept of the **determinant** of a matrix. We will start by defining and learning how to compute the determinant for **$2 \times 2$ matrices**, and then extend this to **$3 \times 3$ matrices** and  **$n \times n$ matrices**, using a systematic method.

We will explore the **basic properties** of the determinant, including how row operations affect its value. A central result that will be highlighted is the **relationship between the determinant and a matrix's invertibility** â€“ a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.

Depending on the precise content of the sections, we may also touch upon the **geometric interpretation** of the determinant, such as its connection to **area** or volume.

### Key Concepts

*   Determinant
*   Calculating 2x2 Determinants
*   Calculating 3x3 Determinants
*   Properties of Determinants
*   Determinant and Invertibility
*   Geometric Interpretation (Area/Volume)
