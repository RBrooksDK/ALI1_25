## Session Description

We've learned about eigenvalues and eigenvectors and how to diagonalize matrices. In this session, we'll see a powerful application of these ideas to the real world: solving systems of linear differential equations! We'll discover how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix connected to the system give us the fundamental building blocks for the solutions.

We'll focus on understanding how these concepts help us find the general solution to systems of equations that describe things changing over time, like population models or coupled systems. The eigenvalues will relate to the exponential growth or decay rates, and the eigenvectors will define the directions of these changes. While this is just an introduction, it highlights how abstract linear algebra tools are essential for tackling dynamic problems in science and engineering.
