## Session Description

This session introduces some of the most powerful and fascinating concepts in linear algebra: eigenvalues and eigenvectors! We'll explore what these special vectors (eigenvectors) and scalars (eigenvalues) are – basically, vectors that only get scaled (not changed in direction) when a matrix transformation is applied. We'll learn how to find eigenvalues by solving the "characteristic equation" and then find the corresponding eigenvectors by solving a system of equations.

Understanding the set of all eigenvectors for a specific eigenvalue (the "eigenspace") is also key. Finally, we'll tackle the concept of "diagonalization" – a super useful technique where we can transform certain matrices into simpler diagonal forms using their eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This process, often called similarity transformation, simplifies many calculations and reveals deeper properties of the matrix and the transformation it represents.
